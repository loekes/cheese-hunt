### Cheese Hunt
A simple platformer game where you play as a mouse looking for all five cheeses in every level, but be careful not to fall on spikes or wake up a sleeping cat!

Programmed in a weekend in 2020 during the first Covid-19 lockdown for kindergarteners to play at home. Project/Code has some issues, mostly when it comes to smooth animations, movement speed/gravity of the player, and file organisation. A playable version of the game is available on [itch.io](https://loekes.itch.io/cheese-hunt).
